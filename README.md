Encoder  And  Decoder 🖥️
===========================
A Encoder with the respective Decoder in Java
---------------------------------------------
This program is a encoder that converts your text into binary.  
Once the text is in binary, the coder, based on the positions of 1s and 0s, introduces a series of 0s that symbolize your message.  
If you input these same 0s into the decoder, you should observe the original text. 😄
